	<h1>Project Proposal - Jay Jung</h1>
	<hr/>
	<h3>What is this Website About</h3>
	<p>My project website will be about the Babson Korean Soccer Team. Each semester, the Babson Korean Student Association(BKSA) forms a soccer team.
		The BKSA soccer team participates in numerous matches with other Massachusetts colleges.
		In addition, the team participates in a tournament where even schools from New York come to participate at the end of the semester.
		The BKSA soccer team has regularly participated in this tournament, and has one several prizes from the tournament.
	</p>
	<hr/>
	<h3>The Objective of this Website</h3>
	<p>The objective of this website will be to introduce and organize the BKSA soccer team.
		Despite having a long history, the BKSA soccer team has never had an official website to see how it does.
		By offering a website for the team, our coaches, fans, and managers will be able to more easily observe how the players are doing each week.		
	</p>
	<hr/>
	<h3>My Target Audience</h3>
	<p>My target Audience will be the players in the BKSA soccer team, the coaches, the managers, and the fans who support our team.
		People who visit the website will be able to access information on the team without wasting there time asking around. 
		Furthermore, I hope to introduce this site to the soccer tournament committee.
		By doing so, the team will be able to participate in the tournament without going through unnecessary inspections.
	</p>

	<h3>The Content I plan to Include</h3>
	<p>First, I want to add a page introducing the current soccer team. Through this page, visitors of the website will be able to know what kind of page they are looking at.
		Second, I would like to write about the history of the BKSA soccer team. Through this page, visitors will be able to recognize the vast amount of prizes that the team has won.
		Third, I would like to have a page on recent events. In this page, news about recent games and the conditions of the players will be posted.
		Finally, I will add a page about the playes and coaches of the team.
