	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p><img src="images/about me.jpg" alt="Oops, I'm not here" title="a photo of myself" width="150px" />Many students come to <a href="http://www.babson.edu/Pages/default.aspx">Babson College</a>, expecting a great education on business.
		 During my senior year in highschool, I had 2 primary interests.
		 The 2 were soccer and making money. Having a job allowed me to earn money for the first time, and I was soon to learn the joy of earning money myself.
		 Naturally, I became interested in business.
		 Having been interested in business, I was looking for colleges that provided a great curriculum in business. 
		 Out of these schools, the fact that Babson provided the top entrepreneurship program attracted me.
		 Although I had never heard of Babson, many people spoke of Babson highly.
		 And after finally hearing about the great FME program Babson offers, I did not hesitate to apply for Babson.
		 At Babson, I am majoring in marketing and economics.
		 And With the great education on business I have earned from Babson, I plan on going back to my home, South Korea, to find a job related with sports marketing.
		 As a person who loves soccer, I would like to expand the love I have for soccer into the work I do.
		 With the knowledge I have acquired from Babson, I am positive that I too will become a great entrepreneur.

	<h2>My Interests</h2>
	<p>During my free time, I usually play sports. Out of all the sports, my favorite is <a href="http://www.mlssoccer.com/">soccer</a>. 
	Soccer has been the sport for me since when I was 5 years old. My father would take me to stadiums around the world to watch games on the top class.
	Naturally, I developed an interest in soccer and started playing myself. Even after rupturing my tendon while playing soccer, my love for the sport still lives on.
